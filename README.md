# BasketballPredict

This is an unfinished project I started over Winter Break of 2020/2021 (my junior year in college) that aimed to predict the results of basketball games based off a number of factors. At its current state, it offers a small but statistically insignificant improvement in accuracy in predicting which team would cover. Using a Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, or Neural Network model would be my next step.
